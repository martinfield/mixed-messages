# Mixed Messages

Mixed Messages is a JavaScript Application that creates a new randomized message upon execution using four variables based on nouns, verbs and quotes. Variables take elements from some of my favourite pop culture references. 


## Installation

Clone the git repository into your local text editor. Either through Git Desktop or through the command line.



## Usage Examples

```javascript 
// Running the application will give results such as:

Mario suited up and shouted "Little birds should stay away from big bad kittycats."

Iron Man looked across at their rival and whispered "Its a-me!"

Gandalf leaped into the air and whispered "I missed the part where that is my problem."
```
